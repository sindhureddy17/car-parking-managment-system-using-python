This project is a Car Parking Management System developed using Python, designed to efficiently manage urban parking spaces. It provides a real-time parking slot availability display, ensuring optimal space utilization and enhancing user experience.

Key Features of the System:

1. Real-time Parking Slot Monitoring

The system dynamically updates parking slot status as vehicles enter and exit.

Users can query the system to check for available slots.



2. Digital Representation of Parking Lot

The parking lot is divided into discrete slots.

A graphical or command-line interface provides real-time slot status.



3. Automated Parking Slot Allocation

The system efficiently assigns parking spaces based on availability.

Helps in reducing congestion and optimizing space usage.



4. User-Friendly Interface

Displays current parking slot status, distinguishing between occupied and vacant slots.

Enables users to make informed parking decisions before entering the lot.




Expected Benefits:

Improves parking efficiency by minimizing time spent searching for slots.

Reduces traffic congestion around parking lots.

Enhances user experience with real-time updates.
